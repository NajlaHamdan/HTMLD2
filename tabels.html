    <h3>difference between input type button and submit</h3>
    <p>input type="button" / buttons will not submit a form - they don't do anything by default. They're generally used in conjunction with JavaScript as part of an AJAX application.
        ....input type="submit" buttons will submit the form they are in when the user clicks on them, unless you specify otherwise with JavaScript.
        the BUTTON element may have content. For example, a BUTTON element that contains an image functions like and may resemble an INPUT element whose type is set to “image”, but the BUTTON element type allows content.
